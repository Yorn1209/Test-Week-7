# Test-Week-7

This was a school project where I had to make an arduino project. The project had to involve 1 sensor, 1 display and some other component.
I chose to make a something like a simulated drone with 4 LED's for the propellors and a MPU 6050 sensor to determine what position the drone is in. (tilted left, right, bottom up, top part up). The result is displayed on a local display and also on a blynk app on my phone. On th blynk app you can also turn de LED's on for 1 second.

I used the ESP 32 devkit v1 module to control the whole thing and the build in WIFI module to connect it to the blynk app. The display i used is an OLED I2C display.
